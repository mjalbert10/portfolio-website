          This design is grounded in the idea of stepping out of routine and appreciating the details that tend to go unnoticed. Gaver and Martin argue that designing outside of the norm can lead to unique engagements between users and their environments. By having the glasses highlight existing details, like sounds and nature, users are engaging more with their surroundings in a way that promotes positivity.

          This design focuses on integrating small changes in order to improve existing products and cause an impact for its environment and users. Edgerton explained that a significant design does not need to be high-tech, just just unique enough to stand out in usability. The proposed pen would integrate a latch protecting exposed ink from drying out, which increases longevity and reduces rate at which ink and  pens need to be replaced.
